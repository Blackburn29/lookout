# lookout

This is an unofficial Microsoft Outlook client. The official one from Microsoft is retired and got replaced with PWA. Read the blog [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-outlook-blog/microsoft-outlook-progressive-web-app-now-available-on-linux/ba-p/3669846).

Please report bugs and enhancements in the issues section. We will attend them as soon as possible. Please review the open/close issues before raising a new one and avoid duplicates. We encourage everyone to join our chat room in [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#lookout_community:gitter.im) and ask your questions. That's probably the quickest way to find solutions. Alternatively open a github discussion.

As this is a wrapper around the web version of outlook, we would not be able to add certain features. It's not because we don't want to, but we're fully dependent on Microsoft in certain cases. We may close the issue stating the same reason.

PRs and suggestions are welcomed. We will continue to support the community.
